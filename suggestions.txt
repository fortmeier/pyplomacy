General suggestions
###################
- Renaming "Players" (from map) to "Nations".
- "Players" should be the actual agents, with their names and IP/address

Dirk: Full Ack.

- Territories should not require to supply graph-coordinates, but rather center-coordinates of countries in a map-image
Dirk: Might be interesting for debugging purposes to have a graph independant of the SVG based visualization
- Map should be provided as SVG?
Dirk: Yes!
